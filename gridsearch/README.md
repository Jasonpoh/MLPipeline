To run a grid search, create a directory with a name that uniquely
identifies your grid search:

$ mkdir mygrid

Copy the sample_config.ini to the directory, renaming it config.ini:

$ cp sample_config.ini mygrid/config.ini

Make any modifications necessary to the config file, and run the bash script:

$ bash grid_search.sh
